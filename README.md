## Project Overview
Upon initial exploration of the “Sexual Harassment in Academia” data set and of the barebones tool that exists for exploring the data, we quickly came to the decision that what was aggregated here needed to be communicated more effectively—specifically to bring awareness to the hidden sexual misconduct that occurs in academia. We decided to focus on a specific subset of the data—the event itself, the role/rank of the target, the role/rank of the perpetrator, the academic discipline that the victim and/or perpetrator belongs/belonged to, and the power difference/gap between the target and perpetrator—with the goals of revealing which academic disciplines appear to have a higher incidences of sexual misconduct, which academic rank appear to be most frequently committing sexual harassment, revealing the imbalance and abuse of power in a majority of these accounts, and humanizing the data by allowing our audience to read these personal stories of abuse.

Our design features a series of bar graph visualizations that possess the functionality to filter and sort the data by rank/role. The starting visualizations depict the role/rank of victims or perpetrators so our audience can identify which role/rank appears to be most at risk of sexual harassment/assault and where a majority of the abusers come from. The user also has the option of filtering the data to view incidents within a specific rank/role. The data is further organized by academic discipline to order the academic fields by number of reported incidents. We also include a visualization that communicates the power gap between victim and perpetrator using a diverging color scale; this scale allows the user(s) to identify trends and patterns in power dynamics relative to cases of sexual misconduct.

Our final communication goal is to allow our user to read each of these individual accounts so that they may understand the size and scope of the issue of sexual harassment/assault in academia and to provide victims a space to share their story without fear of repercussions. Reading these stories not only reveals the severity of the sexual abuse that occurs but also the systematic protection and valuing of the abusers over the victims.

## Audience
Our intended primary audience for our visualizations are university administrators (deans, chairs, and department heads). By effectively communicating this aggregated data to university administrators about the size, severity, and cultural norms of sexual misconduct in academia, we hope to facilitate more conversation about it and to spur administrators to create more effective institutional policies and interventions. Hopefully through our visualization, we can help generate some impact in the pervasive sexual misconduct in academia.
